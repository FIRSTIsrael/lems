# LEMS/Presentations

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

A simple presentation framework allowing dynamic slides deck creation.
Based off of Formidable's [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/tree/a9b73ac1fd9965b9439864a3657943fa5cf68688) and adapted to fit LEMS.
