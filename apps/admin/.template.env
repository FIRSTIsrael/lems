# This is a template .env.local file for the admin application.
# In order for all LEMS features to work properly, you will need to fill in
# the sensitive values which have been omitted from this file, and
# rename this file to `.env.local` in the `apps/admin` directory.

# IMPORTANT: Environment Variable Timing
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are embedded at BUILD TIME (cannot be changed at runtime)
# - Other variables are loaded at RUNTIME (can be changed via docker-compose/env)
# 
# For Docker deployments:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars must be set in GitHub Actions during the build step
# - Runtime vars are set in compose.yml and passed to the container
